1. If I include only the header file  in the file containing the main() function, how does the file with main() access the definitions of those functions?
2. What are the technical names for the files containing the main function and the file containing the definitions of those functions?
3. While compiling the c files in the terminal, do we have to include the header file as well? After all it is included in the file with the main function and the
    definitions of other functions.
4. Problem no. a7_p1: when a6_p8 was split into multiple files the printlist function(or potentially all functions) stopped working. 
5. What are commands in the Makefile? Examples in context of an actual Makefile.
6. For a function that doesn't take any arguments, can we declare it as void (*fct) ()? Or should we specify the type of the argument as "void"?
