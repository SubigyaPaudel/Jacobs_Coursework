Removing the "using namespace std;" lead to the datatypes - like string - and the streams - like cin and cout - undefined. The functions and
datatypes have their on unique meaning depending on the namespace used in the source code. Thus, not specifying the namespace leaves the
datatypes and the functions used in the program incomprehensible to the compiler, thus leading to compiliation errors. Adding "std::" in 
front of the functions and datatypes declared in namespace std, will solve the problem.

Removing "Critter::" from one of the methods leads to errors because it is not known for which class the method is defined. When the method 
tries to access certain elements contained within a certain class, cannot access them, and those variables also remain undefined leading
to compliation errors. If the Critter:: is removed from a method, then in order for the method to work, the method should be defined within 
the class itself i.e. make the function an inline function.
